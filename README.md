JunkFactory
JunkFactory is a cross-platform graphical file generator implemented in Python. It is designed to efficiently create large files—including sparse files—through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).The application is particularly useful for generating placeholder, test, or dummy files, without actually consuming disk space when sparse mode is enabled.（Note: Currently, only the Chinese language is supported.）
