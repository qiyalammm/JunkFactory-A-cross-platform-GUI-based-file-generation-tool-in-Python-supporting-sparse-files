# JunkFactory

**JunkFactory** is a cross-platform graphical file generator implemented in **Python**.

It is designed to efficiently create large files — including **sparse files** — through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The application is particularly useful for generating **placeholder**, **test**, or **dummy** files without actually consuming disk space when *sparse mode* is enabled.

> **Note:** Currently, only the **Chinese** language is supported.
